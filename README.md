# GeoFS-Radio

It's literally just a radio...
**PLEASE READ THE FULL README BEFORE USE!**
## Features:
- Full COMM airband frequency selection for realistic ATC ops.
- Line-of-Sight signal degradation
- Up to 1000 simultaneous links
- Realistic PTT behavior
- Heterodyning (Annoying tone when people talk over each other.)

## Requirements:
- **BY USING THIS PLUGIN, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 13.**
- You MUST use Google Chrome for this addon to work. Firefox does not seem to work at this time.
- You NEED a microphone in order to connect. If you do not have one, you will not be able to connect to the network.
- You NEED a stable internet connection
- You SHOULD familiarize yourself with proper radio usage before connecting to the network.

## Usage:
This addon is provided as a Tampermonkey-compatible userscript. (*If you do not have TM, just paste the script directly into the console.*) <br>
To open the radio panel, press the new "COMM" button below the "RADIO" button. To close, use the "X" in the corner of the panel. <br>
You will be presented with 3 tabs; <br>
### Program:

This is where you will program frequencies into the radio. To change frequencies, use the dial to the left of the "STANDBY" box. <br>
Alternatively, you can type the frequency into the STANDBY box. You will then need to press the "SWAP" button to set it to the ACTIVE box. <br>

### Peers:

This tab lists all of the currently connected peers, as well as your reference information. <br>
If a user is being disruptive, you may mute the user with the "mute" button beside their ID. <br>
Peers who are actively transmitting will display "TX". <br>

### Options:

You can set your PTT key(s) in this tab, as well as adjust some other settings. You may set a PTT key for your keyboard and a connected gamepad.

## Etiquette:

There are two "lights" in the upper right corner of the radio panel. <br>
"TX" will light up when you transmit. "RX" will light up when you recieve a signal. <br>
If both lights illuminate at the same time, you are being "stepped on" and your message will likely be missed. <br>
Here are some general radio etiquette guidelines:
- Don't transmit while someone else is speaking. Take turns.
- Don't turn your mic gain too high.
- Don't hog a frequency. (AKA, do not transmit constantly for no reason)
- Do not play audio files, sound board clips, etc. on frequency.
- Do not connect to the network from several instances of GeoFS.
- Monitor 121.5 when not actively using another frequency.
- Do not use profanity or any type of unwanted language.
- Do not make excessively long transmissions.
- DO brief yourself on proper radiotelephony procedures.
- Disable the radio addon when not in use.
- Be courteous.

## Restrictions:
- You may not place undue strain on the p2p network.
- You may not send more requests to the connection server than would be generated by two instances of the addon.
- You may not use the network for illegal activity
- You may not use this network if you are under the age of 13.

## Data Policy:
  While this plugin is primarily a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, due to the nature of WebRTC there must be a server to initiate connections. <br>
  The data sent to the server includes Non-Personally Identifiable Information that cannot be traced back to you. <br>
  The server does not handle any audio, and is simply used to initiate connections between clients. <br>
  We store all requests sent to the server for an indefinite amount of time for debugging and administrative purposes.

## Troubleshooting:
### Cannot connect to network:
- Ensure that there are no network restrictions in place.
- Ensure that you have a microphone connected.
- Ensure that you have multiplayer enabled.
- Ensure that you are using Google Chrome

### Peers showing "Connected", but no audio:
- Ensure that you have set your audio device properly in your OS settings.
- Ensure that you are within range of the transmitting user.
- Ensure that the page is not muted and that "VOLUME" is not 0.

### Connection drops while on frequency:
- Try switching to another frequency and then back. This will reset your connection.
- Check your internet connection.

### Apparent Widespread Outage:
- It is possible that the connection server is down or has reached quota. Contact Ariakim for further details.
